## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

This program lets you create a playlist with your top songs of the past four weeks on Spotify. It also lets you schedule the creation of this playlist automatically using the Windows Task Scheduler.

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

<!-- This section explains  -->

### Prerequisites

Create a new app on [the Spotify developer dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/). Give it a name like BOTM so, you can remember what the app is for.

After you created the app you should see the its overview with the Client ID:
![Image showing where the Client ID can be found](assets/Client%20ID.png)

And under that there is the button to reveal your client secret.

Next, go to `EDIT SETTINGS` on the overview page:
![Showing where the edit settings button is located](assets/Edit%20settings.png)

There add `https://localhost:8081` (The number after the `:` is the port and has to be the same that is set in the application itself) as a Redirect URI (Remember to click ADD):

### Installing

[Download](https://github.com/gaweringo/BOTM/releases) the exe from the releases page. And run it. It is a portable application, meaning it does not need to be installed, it will just open.

## üéà Usage <a name="usage"></a>

Fill out the Configuration, run `Generate BOTM` and follow the instructions. If everything works as intended you should see your BOTM playlist in a few seconds.
